# Our Journey Through the 7-Day Hackathon

The 7-day hackathon was an incredible experience for us as a team. We worked collaboratively to build a dynamic marketplace, overcoming challenges and achieving milestones each day. Here's a detailed look at our journey:

---

## Day 1: Understanding the Marketplace

We began the hackathon by diving into the basics of E-Commerce, Q-Commerce, and Rental E-Commerce. After analyzing the differences, we decided on the type of marketplace that aligned with our vision. Brainstorming sessions helped us identify key business entities and draft an initial data schema. The template we selected had a modern and minimalistic design, ensuring user-friendliness and clarity.

## Day 2: Planning the Technical Foundation

On the second day, we shifted our focus to technical planning. We finalized the tech stack, which included Next.js for the frontend and Sanity CMS for content management. Organizing the folder structure was crucial at this stage to maintain scalability and efficiency as the project grew.

## Day 3: API Integration

This day marked a significant milestone as we successfully integrated APIs with Sanity CMS. We fetched data dynamically and displayed it on the frontend. Special attention was given to securing API keys and endpoints to maintain project integrity and data security.

## Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components

We concentrated on creating responsive and reusable components for the frontend. Key pages like product listings and product details were developed with a user-friendly interface. Ensuring cross-device and browser compatibility was a priority, making our marketplace accessible to all users.

## Day 5: Testing and Refinement

We conducted rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs. Backend integration was refined to improve data accuracy and synchronization. Additionally, we documented all test scenarios and results in a comprehensive test case report, providing a clear overview of our testing efforts.

## Day 6: Deployment Preparation

The final day involved organizing all project files into a structured hierarchy:

- `/src`: Contained the applicationâ€™s source code.
- `/public`: Stored static assets like images.
- `/documents`: Included all reports and documentation from Day 1 to Day 6.

We also set up a staging environment and performed performance testing using tools like PageSpeed Insights. The results were analyzed, and necessary optimizations were made to enhance the website's speed and usability.

## Hackathon Template and Review

Our chosen template played a vital role in the project. Its clean and minimalistic design provided a solid foundation for showcasing products effectively. The systematic approach we followed throughout the hackathon ensured that we stayed on track and met our goals.

Reflecting on this journey, we are proud of what we have accomplished as a team. Each day presented unique challenges, but through collaboration and persistence, we delivered a scalable, user-friendly marketplace that we are excited to share with the world.
