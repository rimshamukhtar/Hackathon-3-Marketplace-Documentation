# Hackathon-3-Marketplace-Documentation
# Our Journey Through the 7-Day Hackathon

The 7-day hackathon was an incredible experience for us as a team. We worked collaboratively to build a dynamic marketplace, overcoming challenges and achieving milestones each day. Here's a detailed look at our journey:

#Day 1: Understanding the Marketplace

We began the hackathon by diving into the basics of #E-Commerce, #Q-Commerce, and #Rental E-Commerce. After analyzing the differences, we decided on the type of marketplace that aligned with our vision. Brainstorming sessions helped us identify key business entities and draft an initial data schema. The template we selected had a modern and minimalistic design, ensuring user-friendliness and clarity.

#Day 2: Planning the Technical Foundation

On the second day, we shifted our focus to technical planning. We finalized the tech stack, which included #Next.js for the frontend and #Sanity CMS for content management. Organizing the folder structure was crucial at this stage to maintain scalability and efficiency as the project grew.

#Day 3: API Integration

This day marked a significant milestone as we successfully integrated #APIs with #Sanity #CMS. We fetched data dynamically and displayed it on the frontend. Special attention was given to securing API keys and endpoints to maintain project integrity and data security.

Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components
